# Custom integrations

Rather than accessing Cobrowse.io via our website, many of our customers integrate the agent-side UI directly into their own applications.&#x20;

We provide a variety of resources to make this as easy as possible, including:

* [Agent SDK](agent-sdk/) (client-side JavaScript SDK)
* [Agent UI component library](agent-sdk/) (written in React)
* [Authentication (JWTs) ](json-web-tokens-jwts/) (automatic authentication and permission scoping)
* [IFrame embeds](custom-iframe-embeds.md) (eg. to embed the entire Cobrowse.io dashboard)

Using a combination of these resources, Cobrowse.io can be seamlessly integrated as a white-labeled feature into your own products and services.&#x20;

After your initial Cobrowse account setup, there's no need to register each individual user to your Cobrowse account - this is all done automatically through use of [JWTs](json-web-tokens-jwts/).
