## Overview

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must install our Zendesk apps using the marketplace links below in order for your Cobrowse.io account to be linked to your Zendesk organization. Do not sign up via our website first, as this will create an unlinked account!
{% endhint %}

Cobrowse.io provides an integration with both Zendesk Support and Zendesk Chat available in the Zendesk App Marketplace.

### Zendesk Requirements

You must have an active trial/subscription with Zendesk Support (even to use our App with Zendesk Chat). This is a requirement from Zendesk to use their secure authentication that is not available for Apps on Chat-only accounts.

### Zendesk App Marketplace links

Newer accounts will only need to install the Cobrowse.io for Support app, it is  100% compatible with Zendesk Messaging and the new Sunshine Conversations widget.

If you are using the Legacy Zendesk Chat you will also need to install the Cobrowse.io for Chat app.
