### Zendesk Requirements

You must have an active trial/subscription with Zendesk Support (even to use our App with Zendesk Chat). This is a requirement from Zendesk to use their secure authentication that is not available for Apps on Chat-only accounts.

### Zendesk App Marketplace links

Newer accounts will only need to install the Cobrowse.io for Support app, it is  100% compatible with Zendesk Messaging and the new Sunshine Conversations widget.

If you are using the Legacy Zendesk Chat you will also need to install the Cobrowse.io for Chat app.

* [Cobrowse.io for Support App](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/support/cobrowseio/)&#x20;
* [Cobrowse.io for Chat App](https://www.zendesk.com/apps/chat/cobrowseio/)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Installing our Zendesk apps using the marketplace links will automatically create a new Cobrowse account and a new license key. If you've already have a Cobrowse account you may switch between your accounts by clicking your avatar on the Cobrowse dashboard.
{% endhint %}

### Add our SDKs to get started!

See [Getting started](../../) to add our SDKs and begin end-to-end testing! Your license key can be found in your Account Settings, seen above.

### Controlling user access

Follow the Zendesk docs to restrict access to the Cobrowse.io Apps to certain roles or groups [https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409155972378-Managing-your-installed-apps#topic\_xyf\_wmw\_qfb](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409155972378-Managing-your-installed-apps#topic_xyf_wmw_qfb).

### Configure privileges

Zendesk Administrators accounts are also granted Administrator privileges within Cobrowse.io. All other Zendesk accounts will be assigned Support Agent privileges.

## Troubleshooting

If you signed up via Zendesk and also via our website dashboard, you will have two accounts. See this link for a description of this problem and the solution [https://support.cobrowse.io/i-have-issues-with-my-zendesk-account](https://support.cobrowse.io/i-have-issues-with-my-zendesk-account).
