## Install Digital and Phone Support

The Cobrowse.io can be added to your Digital and Phone workflows so that agents can start a Cobrowse session from the context of an interaction.&#x20;

Please contact us at [hello@cobrowse.io](mailto:hello@cobrowse.io) and we will assist you with setting up the Phone or Digital scripts  in CXOne Studio.
