# Full device screen sharing

Full device screen sharing allows your support agents to view screens from applications outside of your own. This is often useful where support agents need to check the state of system settings, or need to see the user navigate between multiple applications.

If you do not want this feature, you may completely disable "Full Device upgrade" in your [account settings](../account-configuration.md).

Full device screen sharing is supported by all SDKs. Check below to see if any extra steps are required for your platform:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Web" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
Redaction, annotation, and remote control are disabled when in full device mode via our Web SDK. If you require full desktop redaction, annotation, and remote control, please see our [MacOS](../../sdk-installation/macos.md) and [Windows](../../sdk-installation/windows.md) SDKs, which will require a downloaded utility on the end-user's computer.
{% endhint %}

The Cobrowse.io SDK for Web includes an optional "full device" toggle in the bottom right when running an active session. This feature enables the end-user to share their entire screen on their laptop/desktop, or select individual apps or browser tabs to share (browser dependent).

This is great if the end-user navigates to browser tabs outside of your website, where the Web SDK's JavaScript snippet is not installed, or if the end-user needs to share a PDF, or their entire desktop.

No extra integration work is required to use full device mode via our Web SDK.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Due to browser limitations, this feature is not available on mobile browsers such as mobile Chrome and mobile Safari. Please see our native [Android](../../sdk-installation/android.md) and [iOS](../../sdk-installation/ios.md) SDKs for [full device capabilities](./) on mobile.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="iOS" %}
The Cobrowse.io SDK for iOS allows full device screen capture, but this requires adding a Broadcast Extension when integrating the iOS SDK. Please follow the directions below.

**Add a Broadcast Extension target**

1. Open your Xcode project
2. Navigate to File > New > Target...
3. Pick "Broadcast Upload Extension"
4. Enter a name for the target
5. Uncheck "Include UI Extension"
6. Create the target, noting its bundle ID
7. Change the target SDK of your Broadcast Extension to iOS 12.0 or higher

**Set up Keychain Sharing**

Your app and the app extension you created above need to share some secrets via the iOS Keychain. They do this using their own Keychain group so they are isolated from the rest of your apps Keychain.

In **both** your **app target** and your **extension target** add a Keychain Sharing entitlement for the `io.cobrowse` keychain group.

**Add the bundle ID to your plist**

Take the bundle ID of the **extension** you created above, and add the following entry in your apps `Info.plist` (_Note:_ **not** in the extensions `Info.plist`), replacing the bundle ID below with your own:

```markup
<key>CBIOBroadcastExtension</key>
<string>your.app.extension.bundle.ID.here</string>
```

**Add `CobrowseSDK` to your Broadcast Extension target**

You should already have the `CobrowseSDK` added to your project via the method used during the initial installation.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="SPM" %}
With your broadcast extension target selected click the `+` button under **Frameworks and Libraries** and add `CobrowseSDK` to your extension target.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Adding CobrwseSDK via SPM to the extension target</p></figcaption></figure>
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pods" %}
**Add the new target to your Podfile**

Add the following to your Podfile, replacing the target name with you own extensions target name:

```ruby
# Replace YourExtensionTargetName with your extension target name
target 'YourExtensionTargetName' do
    pod 'CobrowseIO', '~>3'
end
```

_Make sure to run `pod install` after updating your Podfile_
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Carthage" %}
You can now add the same `CobrowseSDK.xcframework` to your broadcast extension target just as you did to your main app target.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Manual" %}
Manually link the `CobrowseSDK.xcframework` to your extension target.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Implement the extension**

Xcode will have added `SampleHandler.swift` or `SampleHandler.m` and `SampleHandler.h` files as part of the target you created earlier. Replace the content of the files with the following:

**Swift**

```swift
import CobrowseIOAppExtension

class SampleHandler: CobrowseIOReplayKitExtension { }
```

**Objective C**

```objectivec
// SampleHandler.h

@import CobrowseIOAppExtension;

@interface SampleHandler : CobrowseIOReplayKitExtension

@end
```

```objectivec
// SampleHandler.m

#import "SampleHandler.h"

@implementation SampleHandler

@end
```

**Build and run your app**

You're now ready to build and run your app. The full device capability is only available on physical devices, it will not work in the iOS Simulator.

If you've set everything up properly, after clicking the blue circular icon you should see the following screen to select your Broadcast Extension.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/broadcast_extension_example.png)

**Troubleshooting**

If full device screen capture on iOS is not working, please check the following:

* Please verify you are testing on a physical device, and not the iOS simulator.
* Please verify you have added the Bundle Id of your Broadcast Extension to your main app's Info.plist as described in our documentation. If you have not, then no options will appear in the list after clicking the blue circular record button.
* Please verify you are not running any other screen recording or screen mirroring software at the same time, as this will interfere.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Android  " %}
The Cobrowse.io SDK for Android will allow full device screen capture, including home screen, device settings, and everything else, just by toggling "full device mode" during an active session.

{% hint style="info" %}
These instructions also apply to .NET Android implementations.
{% endhint %}

No extra integration work is required to use full device mode via our Android SDK.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The SDK uses a service with the foreground type attribute set to `mediaProjection`. You are required to fill in a declaration form on Google Play and provide a video of your app using this permission. See the [Google Play Store requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821?hl=en) for details on listing your app when using this API.

If your app does not use the full device screen capture, you can remove usage of the Media Projection API. In your application `AndroidManifest.xml` file:

* remove `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION` permission declaration by adding the `<uses-permissions />` tag
* remove `foregroundServiceType` attribute from `CobrowseService` declaration by setting the attributes in the `<service />` tag

```xml
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools">

    <uses-permission
        android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PROJECTION"
        tools:node="remove" />

    <application>

        <service
            android:name="io.cobrowse.CobrowseService"
            android:foregroundServiceType=""
            tools:replace="android:foregroundServiceType" />

    </application>
</manifest>
```

You must be using SDK version **v2.32.0** or above.
{% endhint %}

**Notes for unattended access**

For unattended full device access, we strongly recommend:

* Please initiate sessions with push notifications, rather than our default sockets. This will enable unattended access, even when your app has been backgrounded a long time, or force closed. More info at [Initiate sessions with push](../initiate-sessions-with-push.md).
* Please turn off "Require User Consent" prompts at [https://cobrowse.io/dashboard/settings](https://cobrowse.io/dashboard/settings). Otherwise, a user must always accept the consent prompt on the device before a session can start.
* Be wary of battery optimization policies. On some devices you may need to add your app to a battery optimization whitelist to prevent it from killing the push notifications. More info here: [https://dontkillmyapp.com/](https://dontkillmyapp.com/)
* This requires enabling the Accessibility Service when integrating the Android SDK. Please see the [full device remote control docs](full-device-remote-control.md).

**Troubleshooting**

* If the screen is black during full device screen capture, please make sure your views are not marked as secure. More info here: [https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG\_SECURE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/WindowManager.LayoutParams#FLAG_SECURE)
* If you are using Android Enterprise, please ensure your enterprise settings do not disallow screen capture.
* If you get `compile error android:foregroundServiceType not found`, please update your Android project to use `compileSdkVersion 29`.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="React Native" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
Please follow the iOS and Android documentation to implement full device capabilities on React Native.
{% endhint %}

**Troubleshooting**

* For React Native on iOS, some clients have reported that Xcode does not automatically create the _\{{extensionname\}}.entitlements_ file in the extension directory, which is necessary for the "io.cobrowse" keychain sharing to work.
* If you're not using `use_frameworks!` within CocoaPods, Xcode 13.3 and newer might not copy CobrowseIOExtension.framework extension dependency into resulting IPA builds. If this happens to you, please follow the guide under `iOS` -> `SPM` to create the script to copy `CobrowseIOAppExtension.framework` into the IPA on each build.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Flutter" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
Please follow the iOS and Android documentation to implement full device capabilities on Flutter.
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title=".NET iOS" %}
{% hint style="info" %}
Please review the iOS documentation for full device capabilities first.

This documentation specific to .NET iOS is supplementary, and covers the differences only.
{% endhint %}

**Add a Broadcast Extension project**

In Visual Studio for Mac:

1. Open your .NET solution
2. Right click on the solution, select Add > New Project...
3. Navigate iOS > Extension
4. Pick "Broadcast Upload Extension"
5. Enter a name for the target, e.g. `YourApp.iOS.BroadcastUploadExtension`
6. Select your iOS app to add the extension to
7. Create the location for the extension and press "Create"
8. Visual Studio for Mac will create two extension projects for you: `YourApp.iOS.BroadcastUploadExtension` and `YourApp.iOS.BroadcastUploadExtensionUI`. The second project is not required and you can safely delete it.
9. Change the target SDK of your Broadcast Extension target to at least iOS 10.0

{% hint style="info" %}
Visual Studio for Mac might not have project templates for iOS extensions in .NET. You can install [`DotNetTemplates from NuGet.org`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VladislavAntonyuk.DotNetTemplates) and then run the following command:

```
dotnet new ios-broadcast-upload-extension -n YourBroadcastProjectName --applicationId com.youprojectid.myapp.myapp
```
{% endhint %}

**Set up Keychain Sharing**

Your app and the app extension you created above need to share some secrets via the iOS Keychain. They do this using their own Keychain group so they are isolated from the rest of your apps Keychain.

In **both** your **iOS app** and your **extension project** add a Keychain Sharing entitlement for the "io.cobrowse" keychain group.

**Add the bundle ID to your plist**

Take the bundle ID of the **extension** you created above, and add the following entry in your apps `Info.plist` (_Note:_ **not** in the extensions `Info.plist`), replacing the bundle ID below with your own:

```markup
<key>CBIOBroadcastExtension</key>
<string>your.app.extension.bundle.ID.here</string>
```

**Add the Cobrowse.io AppExtension NuGet**

The app extension needs a dependency on the CobrowseIO app extension framework. Add the following NuGet to the **extension project** (not to the iOS app project):

* [![CobrowseIO.DotNet.iOS.AppExtension NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/CobrowseIO.DotNet.iOS.AppExtension.svg?label=CobrowseIO.DotNet.iOS.AppExtension)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CobrowseIO.DotNet.iOS.AppExtension/) - .NET iOS

**Implement the extension**

Visual Studio will have added `SampleHandler.cs` file as part of the extension project you created earlier. Replace the content of the file with the following:

```csharp
using Cobrowse.IO.iOS.AppExtension;

namespace MauiSample.iOS.BroadcastUploadExtension
{
    [Register("SampleHandler")]
    public class SampleHandler : CobrowseIOReplayKitExtension
    {
        protected SampleHandler(NativeHandle handle) : base (handle)
        {
        }
    }
}
```

**Make sure Info.plist points to the correct class**

Open Info.plist of the extension project and make sure that `NSExtension` section looks like this:

```markup
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    ...
    <key>NSExtension</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NSExtensionPointIdentifier</key>
        <string>com.apple.broadcast-services-upload</string>
        <key>NSExtensionPrincipalClass</key>
        <string>SampleHandler</string>
        <key>RPBroadcastProcessMode</key>
        <string>RPBroadcastProcessModeSampleBuffer</string>
    </dict>
</dict>
</plist>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS" %}
The Cobrowse.io SDK for macOS will allow full device screen capture, including home screen, device settings, and everything else, just by toggling "full device mode" during an active session.

No extra integration work is required to use full device mode via our macOS SDK.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
Full device screen share by default, no extra integration needed.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
