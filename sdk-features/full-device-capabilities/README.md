# Full device capabilities

If you wish, you can allow your support agents to upgrade in-app Cobrowse sessions to allow screen sharing from the entire device. For example, to capture other apps and settings on mobile, or the entire screen of a computer.

### Full device options

Full device screen share is supported on all SDKs. See these docs for how to set up full device screen sharing in your app:

{% content-ref url="full-device-screen-sharing.md" %}
[full-device-screen-sharing.md](full-device-screen-sharing.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

Where platforms allow, we also support full device remote control. This allows you to take complete control of a remote device to assist with complex issues outside of your app. See these docs for supported platforms and setup instructions:

{% content-ref url="full-device-remote-control.md" %}
[full-device-remote-control.md](full-device-remote-control.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
