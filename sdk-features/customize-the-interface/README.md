# Customize the interface

Cobrowse.io provides some minimal default UI in the SDKs for things like user consent and to visually indicate when a session is active.

Many customers are happy to use our default UI which works out of box. This is a great way to get started. But if you prefer, everything is easily customizable to meet your specific requirements.

### Customizing consent prompts

Some actions in a cobrowsing session may require extra consents from the user, here's how you can customize the UI that is shown:

{% content-ref url="user-consent-dialog.md" %}
[user-consent-dialog.md](user-consent-dialog.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="remote-control-consent.md" %}
[remote-control-consent.md](remote-control-consent.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="full-device-consent-dialog.md" %}
[full-device-consent-dialog.md](full-device-consent-dialog.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Customizing in-session UIs

When a Cobrowse session is active it is a good idea to show an indicator to the user, and provide a way for them to end the session if they wish. Here's how you can do that:

{% content-ref url="customize-session-controls.md" %}
[customize-session-controls.md](customize-session-controls.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="localization.md" %}
[localization.md](localization.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

### Customizing code generation

If you choose to use 6-digit codes to connect your support agents with end users, here's how you can customize the code when they're displayed to your user:

{% content-ref url="customize-6-digit-code-screen.md" %}
[customize-6-digit-code-screen.md](customize-6-digit-code-screen.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
